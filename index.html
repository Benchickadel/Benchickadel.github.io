            My name is Ben! I'm a dad, teacher, artist and pizza fanatic! I have been interested in digital fabrication since I saw my first laser cut piece of acrylic. Since then I have been using laser cutters, water jet cutters and 3D printers in my art as well in the classroom with my students. Introducing a 1st grader to a 3D printer or laser cutter is a very fun experience but helping them understand how to use it is even greater. I have extensive backround in ceramics and building stuff. I have built a few printers when I didn't know how so I have learned a lot along the way and am happy to help where I can. </p>

            I am excited to start the plans for pizza oven 2.0.  Pictured above is the inside of my first oven that is sadly no longer. I have a few tools to design and hoping this class can help me do that!

            I have used Rhino for a project years ago but haven't really used it since then. I am excited to get into the code of 3D design, CAD and CAM a bit more.
